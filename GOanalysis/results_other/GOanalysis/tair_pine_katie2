Work on one of the gene models AT1G72050.2 showed that it encodes a protein with nine Cys(2)-His(2)-type zinc fingers, a characteristic feature of TFIIIA proteins. AT1G72050.2 also contains a 23 amino acid spacer between fingers 1 and 2, a 66 amino acid spacer between fingers 4 and 5, and a 50 amino acid non-finger C-terminal tail. in vitro assay demonstrated that AT1g72050.2 binds to 5S rDNA and efficiently stimulates the transcription of 5S rRNA.
